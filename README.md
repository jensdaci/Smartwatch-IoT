# Smartwatch-IoT
A smartwatch using the ESP8266 as the main microcontroller and hardware components such as an OLED screen, an accelerometer, a light sensor, and piezo buzzers. AWS Cloud Database + Android Application

Collaborators: Endric Daues, Jens Daci, Daniel Klass

- MicroPython used to implement features such as setting time and alarm, and adjustable brightness level based on ambient lighting.
- A smartphone application using Android Studio (Java) to send voice commands to the smartwatch.
- Utilized several APIs to obtain geographical location, real-time weather information, and integrate Twitter into the device.
- Implemented a machine learning algorithm for gesture recognition using MongoDB through the Amazon AWS Cloud database.

The following project video shows all of the features:
